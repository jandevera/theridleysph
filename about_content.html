		<p>A four-piece band with members from UP and UST. The Ridleys, composed of Benny Manaligod (vocals, songwriter, guitarist), Jan de Vera (backup vocals, guitarist, Joric Canlas (bassist), and Bryant Ayes (drummer) whose goal is to tell stories through songs. The band has released 2 EPs so far, and is planning to release an full-length album in the future.</p>
		<p>The band started out as a nameless trio. Benny has been writing songs since 2012 (click <a href="https://theridleys.bandcamp.com/album/the-one-only-i-can-see">here</a>!) but he never performed them publicly (he only shared them to his close friends). In 2015, he was given an opportunity to perform them in public (at UP Town Center) for the first time, but he was hesitant. He called his best friend, Bry, and his schoolmate, Jan, to perform with him. That how it all started.</p>
		<p>At the start of 2016, we had the opportunity to record an EP with Kian Ransom (from The Ransom Collective). We recorded some of his songs from his collection and released them online last March 2016 as 'Aphrodite EP'.</p>
		<p>Last September 9, 2017, we released our second EP, 'From Morning Light/'Till Break of Dawn'. This time, we had a launch at Route 196 to celebrate this milestone with our friends and family. It was our first event ever, and it was heartwarming, receiving wonderful comments from them. That night was wonderful!</p>
