		<p>Give me time and I will learn the art<br>
		Choosing my own mind over my heart<br>
		Staring at the shadows all alone<br>
		Driven by the longing to go home</p>

		<p>'Cause honestly I feel so safe around you<br>
		It's unsettling</p>

		<p>She don't know what it means but it doesn't matter<br>
		The fact is I can't forget her<br>
		All these rorschach blots, bottle of scotch are driving me insane<br>
		In every single circumstance<br>
		We see things in a way that makes most sense<br>
		All these rorschach blots, bottle of scotch are messing with my brain</p>

		<p>Build a wooden boat to sail away<br>
		All the sins that haunt you everyday<br>
		As you drift, there's nothing left to say<br>
		Starlit ocean, you will be my grave</p>

		<p>I don't know what it means but it doesn't matter<br>
		The fact is I can't forget her<br>
		All these rorschach blots, bottle of scotch are driving me insane<br>
		In every single circumstance<br>
		We see things in a way that makes most sense<br>
		All these rorschach blots, bottle of scotch are messing with my brain</p>

		<p>You lie in bed<br>
		All your fears are clouding your head<br>
		The words they said<br>
		Got you feeling like you're better off dead<br>
		You call your friends<br>
		But none of them are picking up. No one understands<br>
		All they said, '(we) Won't stop the flow<br>
		No, we won't wait for you'. No, it's not the end</p>

		<p>We're gonna find a way to say we made it through the night</p>

		<p>When your eyes are finally dry<br>
		And you're sick of saying 'well, I tried', I know<br>
		If you think you've lost your mind<br>
		Hold my hand, stay by my side, won't go.<br>
		Explore the roads and possibilities<br>
		We should take it slow<br>
		Let's take our time and make some memories<br>
		I just wanna make them all with you</p>

		<p>You've reached the end<br>
		No more tears to cry. No more broken hearts to mend<br>
		You've reached sweet land<br>
		Sailing through the storm on the ship that you command</p>

		<p>When your eyes are finally dry<br>
		And you're sick of saying 'well, I tried', I know<br>
		If you think you've lost your mind<br>
		Hold my hand, stay by my side, won't go.<br>
		Explore the roads and possibilities<br>
		We should take it slow<br>
		Go to places that we haven't seen<br>
		Feed our mind and soul<br>
		Let's take our time and make some memories<br>
		I just wanna make them all with you</p>

		<p>Strolling hand in hand on lamplit streets at 3am<br>
		Your heart beats, do you want to be mine?<br>
		Do you want to be mine?</p>

		<p>I have no command over these arms that wrapped around your shoulders<br>
		Do you want to be mine?<br>
		Do you want to be mine?</p>

		<p>Make me swear I never missed your warm breath on my ear<br>
		You whisper, 'do you want to be mine?<br>
		Do you want to be mine?'</p>

		<p>The bar is too crowded<br>
		We go to my car and<br>
		Against all good sense<br>
		I am taking my chances<br>
		Shoes on the floor<br>
		And I'm wanting you more<br>
		Baby, lock all the doors<br>
		'Cause I wanna be yours</p>

		<p>Tell me of your search for truth<br>

		<p>Just tell me how you really feel<br>

		<p>I hear them calling<br>
		They're calling out to me<br>
		They tell me freedom is here<br>
		Yeah freedon's finally here<br>
		And all the while rain is falling<br>
		Just like notes on a symphony<br>
		They tell me not to feel fear<br>
		'Cause freedom's finally here</p>

		<p>'Take one bite to take the fall<br>
		And we'll be right next to you throught it all'<br>
		And with these words I saw, with these words I saw</p>

		<p>I once was caged but now I'm free and I don't really wanna go home<br>
		I once was blind but now I see, and I don't really wanna go home<br>
		I've paid the price I know the cost, don't preach to me I know I'm lost<br>
		And if my father calls for me tell him I don't really wanna go<br></p>

		<p>Tell me again<br>
		What's it like on the other side?<br>
		Are you still living in fear?<br>
		Are you still living in fear?<br>
		Aren't we all just human?<br>
		We turn to dust when we die<br>
		And sacrifice every year<br>
		To please the gods we hold dear</p>

		<p>No I don't wanna go back to where I couldn't run<br>
		Do you see me now, I've only just begun<br>
		And I won't stop to lay my head until I reach the sun<br>
		No I don't wanna go back to where I couldn't run</p>

		<p>Take a look back at all the roads we've crossed<br>
		We've gone to Babylon by candlelight<br>
		And though at times we've gotten lost<br>
		Now we're all right, now we're all right</p>

		<p>So, don't let your eyes get drenced in rain<br>
		We did not walk this road in vain<br>

		<p>What I'm about to say will take the kind of courage use to<br>
		Cut a wire from a bomb<br>
		The kinds of things that you will hear will resemble<br>
		A bottle of wine fermented too long<br>
		My mouth is dry I'm up in the sky<br>
		My stomach's starting to dance<br>
		Before I die, I have to try<br>
		I have to take this chance</p>

		<p>Oh there's a risk that you'd go away<br>
		From the friendship we're enjoying right now<br>
		But there might also be regret if we throw away<br>
		The more-than-friendship we'd be missing somehow</p>

		<p>So I was thinking maybe later you would wanna go out<br>
		We could walk around the oval as usual, asking what life is about<br>
		Maybe I'd tell you that the couple years we've spent together<br>
		Touched my life to the core<br>
		Maybe I'd tell you that I love you and I want to love you more</p>

		<p>Tell me how to get to you<br>
		Tell me tell me tell me tell me what you want me to do<br>
		And if you're listening and thinking<br>
		"Is this song about me?"<br>
		Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe</p>

		<p>Oh, you are a work of art<br>
		I'm captivated by the things that you do<br>
		And though I'm jealous of the man who tried to steal your heart<br>
		The goal is that he'd envy me too</p>

		<p>So I was thinking maybe later you would wanna go out<br>
		We could walk, and talk, and travel, read, and watch<br>
		Figure out, what life is about<br>
		Maybe I'd tell you that the couple years we've spent together<br>
		Proved our friendship true<br>
		Maybe I'd tell you that I love you and maybe it's time that you knew<br>
		I know for certain that I love you<br>
		And I hope you love me too</p>

		<p>You're the moon that glows in the sky<br>
		Lighting up my world when it's blue<br>
		Stars they dance though late in the night<br>
		Don't you know they dance just for you?</p>

		<p>There you are above darkened clouds<br>
		Smiling at the world from afar<br>
		With the stars you wander around<br>
		May they follow you wherever you are</p>

		<p>Here I am, just another boy<br>
		Singing songs that others have sung<br>
		Trying to find the words to employ<br>
		To adore the goddess of love</p>

		<p>Oh oh, you got me in a daze<br>
		No oh, it's not another phase<br>
		You gave me one look and now I can't get my mind off of you<br>
		And it's all because</p>

		<p>I see the galaxies when I look in your eyes and I<br>
		Can't speak no I, can't speak at all<br>
		I swear to Zeus you're Aphrodite in disguise<br>
		Don't think that you can hide it from me<br>
		Oh no I never thought I'd get this close to someone so divine oh I<br>
		Can't breathe no I can't breathe at all<br>
		Aphrodite could you could you please be mine oh<br>
		Could you please be mine oh mine</p>

		<p>Here you are, I've waited so long<br>
		Hoping you would sit down and stay<br>
		And with the stars, I'm dancing along<br>
		Like a fool, so you'd look this way</p>

		<p>You're the moon that glows in the sky<br>
		Lighting up my world when it's blue<br>
		And here I sing, though late in the night<br>
		Hope you know I sing just for you</p>
