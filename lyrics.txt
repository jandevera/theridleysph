BABY I DO

Do you ever think of running away?
Do you ever think of saying goodbye because it's foolish to stay?
Do you wanna stay?

Do you ever think that maybe we will never know?
Do you ever think that maybe we should let it go?

After all these years
And with all these fears
Baby I do

Do you ever think of running away?
Do you ever think of saying goodbye? It's gonna end anyway
Someday

You've cried your tears
And I promise it'll all end here
Baby I do

RORSCHACH BLOTS

Give me time and I will learn the art
Choosing my own mind over my heart
Staring at the shadows all alone
Driven by the longing to go home

'Cause honestly I feel so safe around you
It's unsettling

She(/I) don't know what it means but it doesn't matter
The fact is I can't forget her
All these rorschach blots, bottle of scotch are driving me insane
In every single circumstance
We see things in a way that makes most sense
All these rorschach blots, bottle of scotch are messing with my brain

Build a wooden boat to sail away
All the sins that haunt you everyday
As you drift, there's nothing left to say
Starlit ocean, you will be my grave
------------------------------------------------------------------------
TAKE OUR TIME

You lie in bed
All your fears are clouding your head
The words they said
Got you feeling like you're better off dead
You call your friends
But none of them are picking up. No one understands
All they said, '(we) Won't stop the flow
No, we won't wait for you'. No, it's not the end

We're gonna find a way to say we made it through the night

When your eyes are finally dry
And you're sick of saying 'well, I tried', I know
If you think you've lost your mind
Hold my hand, stay by my side, won't go.
Explore the roads and possibilities
We should take it slow
Let's take our time and make some memories
I just wanna make them all with you

You've reached the end
No more tears to cry. No more broken hearts to mend
You've reached sweet land
Sailing through the storm on the ship that you command

When your eyes are finally dry
And you're sick of saying 'well, I tried', I know
If you think you've lost your mind
Hold my hand, stay by my side, won't go.
Explore the roads and possibilities
We should take it slow
Go to places that we haven't seen
Feed our mind and soul
Let's take our time and make some memories
I just wanna make them all with you

DYWTBM

Strolling hand in hand on lamplit streets at 3am
Your heart beats, do you want to be mine?
Do you want to be mine?

I have no command over these arms that wrapped around your shoulders
Do you want to be mine?
Do you want to be mine?

Make me swear I never missed your warm breath on my ear
You whisper, 'do you want to be mine?
Do you want to be mine?'

The bar is too crowded
We go to my car and
Against all good sense
I am taking my chances
Shoes on the floor
And I'm wanting you more
Baby, lock all the doors
'Cause I wanna be yours

(Alt verstion)
The bar is too crowded
I go to my car and
Against all good sense
I let go of my chances
Shoes on the floor
'Cause I'm wanting you more
So I'm closing this door
Though I wanna be yours
